# RouteOptimizer

**RouteOptimizer** is a Flask-based API designed to optimize the delivery routes for trucks carrying packages. It leverages a combination of powerful algorithms to achieve optimal results:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
2. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Dynamic Programming**
3. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**

## Project Description
**RouteOptimizer** is a Flask-based API designed to optimize the delivery routes for trucks carrying packages. It uses a combination of Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path calculations, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using dynamic programming for efficient route planning, and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for overall route optimization.

The application takes input in the form of a graph representing the delivery network, a list of packages, and the available trucks. The goal is to distribute the packages across the trucks while minimizing the overall distance traveled and ensuring that the trucks' weight capacities are not exceeded. The solution aims to maximize efficiency, reduce delivery times, and improve overall logistics management.

This project can be a valuable asset for logistics companies looking to optimize their delivery operations and reduce operational costs.
